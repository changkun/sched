`sched` is a consistently reliable embedded task scheduler library for _GO_. It applies to be a microkernel of an internal application service, and pluggable tasks must implements `sched` **Task** interface.

`sched ` not only schedules a task at a specific time or reschedules a planned task immediately, but also flexible to support periodically tasks, which differ from traditional non-consistently unreliable cron task scheduling.

Furthermore, `sched` manage tasks, like goroutine runtime scheduler, uses priority queue schedules all tasks and a distributed lock mechanism that ensures tasks can only be executed once across multiple replica instances.

## Features

- **Flexible Scheduling** 
  - Single execution, period-equally execution, period-inequally execution
- **Microkernel Embedding**
  - Embedding into an application without change existing code
- **Distributed Reliability**
  - A task can only be executed once across replica instances
- **Eventually Consistency**
  - All tasks that scheduled must be executed eventually
- **Fault Tolerance**
  - Recover when restart, retry if needed or on error

## Getting started

```go
// Init sched database
sched.Init("redis://127.0.0.1:6379/1")

// Create a temporal scheduler
s := sched.New()

// Recover tasks
s.Recover(&ArbitraryTask1{}, &ArbitraryTask2{})
// or 
// sched.Recover(&ArbitraryTask1{}, &ArbitraryTask2{})

// Setup tasks
s.Setup(&ArbitraryTask1{...}, &ArbitraryTask2{...})
// or 
// sched.Setup(&ArbitraryTask1{...}, &ArbitraryTask2{...})

// Launch a task
s.Launch(&ArbitraryTask1{...}, &ArbitraryTask2{...})
// or 
// sched.Launch(&ArbitraryTask1{...}, &ArbitraryTask2{...})
```

## Benchmarks
