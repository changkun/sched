Package sched provides a consistently reliable task scheduler with future support

Introduction

sched is a consistently reliable embedded task scheduler library for Go.
It applies to be a microkernel of an internal application service, and
pluggable tasks must implements sched Task interface.

sched not only schedules a task at a specific time or reschedules a planned
task immediately, but also flexible to support periodically tasks, which
differ from traditional non-consistently unreliable cron task scheduling.

Furthermore, sched manage tasks, like goroutine runtime scheduler, uses
greedy scheduling schedules all tasks and a distributed lock mechanism that
ensures tasks can only be executed once across multiple replica instances.

Usage

Callers must initialize sched database when using sched.
sched schedules different tasks in a priority queue and schedules task with
minimum goroutines when tasks with same execution time arrival:

	// Init sched, with tasks should recovered when reboot
	futures, err := sched.Init("redis://127.0.0.1:6379/1"ï¼Œ &ArbitraryTask1{}, &ArbitraryTask2{})
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	// Retrieve task's future
	for i := range futures {
		fmt.Printf("%v", futures[i].Get())
	}

	// Setup tasks, use future.Get() to retrieve the future of task
	future, err := sched.Submit(&ArbitraryTask1{...}, &ArbitraryTask2{...})
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	fmt.Printf("%v", future.Get())

	// Launch a task, use future.Get() to retrieve the future of task
	future, err := sched.Trigger(&ArbitraryTask1{...}, &ArbitraryTask2{...})
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	fmt.Printf("%v", future.Get())

	// Pause scheduling
	sched.Pause()

	// Resume scheduling
	sched.Resume()

	// Stop scheduler gracefully
	sched.Stop()

Task interface

A Task that can be scheduled by sched must implements the following task interface:

	// Task interface for sched
	type Task interface {
		GetID() (id string)
		SetID(id string)
		IsValidID() bool
		GetExecution() (execute time.Time)
		SetExecution(new time.Time) (old time.Time)
		GetTimeout() (lockTimeout time.Duration)
		GetRetryTime() (execute time.Time)
		Execute() (result interface{}, retry bool, fail error)
	}

Note that your task must be a serilizable struct by `json.Marshal()`,
otherwise it cannot be persist by goshceudler (e.g. `type Func func()` cannot be scheduled)

Task Future

A Task can have a future of its final execution result. `sched.Submit` and `sched.Trigger`
both returns future object of `Execute()`'s `result interface{}`. To get the future:

	future.Get().(YourResultType)
