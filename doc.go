Package sched provides a consistently reliable task scheduler

Introduction

sched is a consistently reliable embedded task scheduler library for GO.
It applies to be a microkernel of an internal application service, and
pluggable tasks must implements sched Task interface.

sched not only schedules a task at a specific time or reschedules a planned
task immediately, but also flexible to support periodically tasks, which
differ from traditional non-consistently unreliable cron task scheduling.

Furthermore, sched manage tasks, like goroutine runtime scheduler, uses
priority queue schedules all tasks and a distributed lock mechanism that
ensures tasks can only be executed once across multiple replica instances.

Usage

Callers must initialize sched database to use goschduler.
goschduler schedules different tasks in a priority queue and schedules task with minimum goroutines when tasks with same execution time arrival:

	// Init sched database
	sched.Init("redis://127.0.0.1:6379/1")

	// Create a temporal scheduler
	s := sched.New()

	// Recover tasks
	s.Recover(&ArbitraryTask1{}, &ArbitraryTask2{})
	// or
	// sched.Recover(&ArbitraryTask1{}, &ArbitraryTask2{})

	// Setup tasks
	s.Setup(&ArbitraryTask1{...}, &ArbitraryTask2{...})
	// or
	// sched.Setup(&ArbitraryTask1{...}, &ArbitraryTask2{...})

	// Launch a task
	s.Launch(&ArbitraryTask1{...}, &ArbitraryTask2{...})
	// or
	// sched.Launch(&ArbitraryTask1{...}, &ArbitraryTask2{...})

Task interface

A Task that can be scheduled by sched must implements the following methods:

	// Interface for a schedulable
	type Interface interface {
		GetID() (id string)
		GetExecution() (execute time.Time)
		GetTimeout() (executeTimeout time.Duration)
		GetRetryDuration() (duration time.Duration)
		SetID(id string)
		SetExecution(new time.Time) (old time.Time)
		Execute() (retry bool, fail error)
	}

Note that your task must be a serilizable struct by `json.Marshal()`,
otherwise it cannot be persist by goshceudler (e.g. `type Func func()` cannot be scheduled)
